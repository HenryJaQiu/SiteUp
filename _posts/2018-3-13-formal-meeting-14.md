### Meeting Content ###




1. Show the last word of vue-cli, electron-vue and electron-builder.

2. Changes:
   Original setting is re-load images after the data, parameter or operator changes but this cost a lot of source. So we decide to use the two-way binding function of echarts and vue in order to auto update instead of re-load every time data changes. This method could decrease cost and increase software efficiency and fluency.
