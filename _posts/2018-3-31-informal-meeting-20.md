### Meeting Content ###

1.The image configuration is further modified to meet the requirements.
<br>
2.Solve such a question.Data is stored in vuex-store as global variables. For convenience, we set constant value first, for example, the number of points can only be set to 100, 500 or 1000. Different values are placed in arrays with different lengths directly to decrease the difficulty of using dynamic arrays in JavaScript. Then a label in int type is created to represent the current selected type. 
<br>
3.We decide to use the getter in vuex to adjust Echart, Output and Button and use action to adjust Input and Start.
