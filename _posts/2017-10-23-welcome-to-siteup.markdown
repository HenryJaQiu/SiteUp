Project Theme: Sequential Monte Carlo

Supervisor: Dr.Liang Dai

Students: Hejia Qiu, Xiang Zhang, Kaiwen Zhang, Zexi Song and Cong Liu

"Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, also called particle filter), is a widely-used
statistical sampling method for simulating random samples from complex dynamical
systems. In this project, we are going to use visualization techniques
to illustrate how the algorithm works and some key features of the algorithm.
In particular we will:
• Illustrate (by visualization) how will the number of particles and different
choices of proposal distributions affect the algorithm’s performance;
• Illustrate different versions of the particle smoothers, which can be regarded
as extensions of the basic particle filter, with nice visualizations."
