1.The command line code of Xiang ZHANG can not function correctly , we need a new method to improve it.

2.We tried various different code languages for our algorithm such as python and java script, but out of user demand and some other reasons, we found it unreasonable for the customers to install python to use our software, so we decide to use java script.
