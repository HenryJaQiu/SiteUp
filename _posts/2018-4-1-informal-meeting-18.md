### Meeting Content ###

1.We put the JavaScrppt's algorithm operation under the ParameterController instead of vuex, because the other components do not need to involve algorithmic logic. They only need to read the initial parameter values and the algorithm results.
<br>
2.Solve a problem: when a variable's value of V-model has changed, the software could not update correctly.
<br>
3.Using a fixed value instead of a variable causes two-way binding of V-model cannot be used. We force change the tupe string into the type int to solve the problem.
